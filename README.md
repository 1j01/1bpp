# one bit per pixel

A game about being abstract, in an abstract, somewhat condescending way.

A game where everything around you is destroyed and rebuilt... by THEM.

It’s basically Terraria with pixel terrain replacing blocks (with more physical water physics of course), colonies of goblins and \whatnot living underground or in cities or whatever according to their species\ trying to survive, modability; very casual (by default).

A game where you try to line up rows of blocks as four-block pieces fall down.

It’s all about scientific experimentation, really.

It’s all about maejyykkvx, really.

It’s a first person shooter.

It’s a boardgame.

It’s delicious.

It’s not.

It is.

It’s.

It.

I.

## [Gallery][]

The game was going to look something like [this][Gallery].

## [Code][]

The code in [`game/project/`][Code]
(as well as the linux build you can download)
is a really disapointingly old version of the game.
It it doesn't have wall jumping;
it doesn't have any particles flying around;
it doesn't have that cool pause screen where multiple views of the world moved around layered on top of each other with different binary filters for a really cool effect.

I'm probably never going to pick up this project unless I can find a newer version of the source code.

I wish there was never a time when I hadn't used source control.
